[hint: Make Prints up to 30% Faster (Safely)]
text = Make Prints up to 30% Faster (Safely)\nGet real throughput, not risky 'speed mode'. A print that normally takes 8 hours might drop to ~5.6 hours.

[hint: Quality Check Before You Hit Print]
text = Quality Check Before You Hit Print\nThink of it like a pre-flight check. Example: if a PC bracket shows low TQI in thin ribs, you'll know to adjust before committing to an overnight run.

[hint: First-Time-Right Reliability]
text = First-Time-Right Reliability\nLess babysitting, more predictable output. Example: a small farm running PETG parts avoids 'fail at hour 6' surprises and keeps batches on schedule.
