# Building BambuStudio with ZAA on macOS

A step-by-step guide to building BambuStudio from source on macOS. No prior experience with building software required.

## What You'll Need

- A Mac running macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- About 15 GB of free disk space
- An internet connection
- About 1-2 hours for the first build (mostly waiting)

## Step 1: Open Terminal

Press **Cmd + Space**, type **Terminal**, and press Enter. A window with a command prompt will appear. All commands below are typed into this window.

## Step 2: Install Xcode Command Line Tools

This installs the compiler and basic development tools.

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

A dialog will pop up. Click **Install** and wait for it to finish (a few minutes).

To verify it worked:

```bash
xcode-select -p
git --version
```

You should see a path like `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools` and a git version. Both git and the C++ compiler are included in the Command Line Tools.

## Step 3: Install Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a package manager that makes it easy to install developer tools on macOS.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow the prompts. When it finishes, it will tell you to run one or two commands to add Homebrew to your PATH. **Run those commands** — they look something like:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

To verify:

```bash
brew --version
```

## Step 4: Install CMake

CMake is the build system BambuStudio uses.

```bash
brew install cmake
```

To verify:

```bash
cmake --version
```

You need version 3.13 or later (anything recent from Homebrew will work).

## Step 5: Clone the Repository

Choose where you want the source code. For example, in your home directory:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/mnott/BambuStudio.git
cd BambuStudio
```

If you want the ZAA feature branch:

```bash
git checkout feature/zaa-contouring
```

## Step 6: Build

The `build.sh` script handles everything. For a first-time build:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh --full
```

This does three things:
1. **Builds dependencies** (Boost, wxWidgets, OpenSSL, etc.) — takes 30-60 minutes the first time
2. **Configures CMake** — sets up the build system (uses Xcode generator)
3. **Builds BambuStudio** — compiles the application

Go get a coffee. The dependency step only needs to run once.

### After the first build

For subsequent builds (after making code changes), just run:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This does an incremental build — only recompiles what changed. Usually takes 1-5 minutes.

### Other build options

```bash
./build.sh --help       # Show all options
./build.sh --clean      # Clean rebuild (if something is broken)
./build.sh --deps       # Rebuild dependencies only
./build.sh --configure  # Reconfigure CMake only
```

## Step 7: Run BambuStudio

After a successful build, the script prints the app location. You can run it with:

```bash
open build/arm64/src/Release/BambuStudio.app
```

Or find `BambuStudio.app` in Finder and double-click it.

## Troubleshooting

### "CMake not found"

Make sure Homebrew is in your PATH (see Step 3), then `brew install cmake`.

### Build fails during dependencies

Some deps need a lot of memory. Close other applications and try again. If a specific dependency fails, check if you have the latest Xcode Command Line Tools:

```bash
softwareupdate --list
```

### wxWidgets "hardcoded path" errors

wxWidgets bakes the installation path into its config files. If you move the source directory after building deps, you need to rebuild them:

```bash
./build.sh --deps
./build.sh --clean
```

### "-lGL not found" linker error

The wxWidgets GL config may reference bare library names. Fix the wx-config file:

```bash
# In deps/build/arm64/BambuStudio_deps/usr/local/lib/wx/config/osx_cocoa-unicode-static-3.1
# Change ldlibs_gl from "libGL.dylib libGLU.dylib" to full paths:
# /usr/X11R6/lib/libGL.dylib /usr/X11R6/lib/libGLU.dylib
```

Or install XQuartz which provides the GL libraries at the expected paths.

### "Permission denied" on build.sh

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
```

### Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) vs Intel

The build script auto-detects your architecture. If you need to specify it explicitly:

```bash
./build.sh --full --arch arm64    # Apple Silicon
./build.sh --full --arch x86_64   # Intel
```

## ZAA (Z Anti-Aliasing)

See [docs/ZAA.md](docs/ZAA.md) for details on the Z Anti-Aliasing feature. In short: enable **Z contouring** in Print Settings > Quality to get smoother curved surfaces.
