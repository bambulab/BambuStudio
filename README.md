# BambuStudio
Bambu Studio is a cutting-edge, feature-rich slicing software.  
It contains project-based workflows, systematically optimized slicing algorithms, and an easy-to-use graphic interface, bringing users an incredibly smooth printing experience.

Prebuilt Windows, macOS 64-bit and Linux releases are available through the [github releases page](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/releases/).

Bambu Studio is based on [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer) by Prusa Research, which is from [Slic3r](https://github.com/Slic3r/Slic3r) by Alessandro Ranellucci and the RepRap community.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/wiki) and the [documentation directory](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/tree/master/doc) for more information.

# What are Bambu Studio's main features?
Key features are:
- Basic slicing features & GCode viewer

# How to compile

This branch builds via [Pixi](https://pixi.sh): all dependencies come
from conda-forge, replacing the legacy `BuildLinux.sh` / `deps/`
ExternalProject flow. Supported targets: Linux 64-bit (glibc ≥ 2.34),
Windows 64-bit (Visual Studio 2019 or 2022), macOS (Apple Silicon).

See [`doc/How to build - Pixi.md`](doc/How%20to%20build%20-%20Pixi.md).
