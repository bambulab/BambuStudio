# BambuStudio
Bambu Studio is a cutting-edge, feature-rich slicing software.  
It contains project-based workflows, systematically optimized slicing algorithms, and an easy-to-use graphic interface, bringing users an incredibly smooth printing experience.

Prebuilt Windows, macOS 64-bit and Linux releases are available through the [github releases page](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/releases/).

Bambu Studio is based on [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer) by Prusa Research, which is from [Slic3r](https://github.com/Slic3r/Slic3r) by Alessandro Ranellucci and the RepRap community.
