校准结果可能因每次校准或材料的不同而有所不同。我们仍在通过固件更新不断提高这种校准的准确性和兼容性。

"Higher chamber temperature can help suppress or reduce warping and potentially lead to higher interlayer bonding strength for high temperature materials like ABS, ASA, PC, PA and so on.At the same time, the air filtration of ABS and ASA will get worse.While for PLA, PETG, TPU, PVA and other low temperature materials,the actual chamber temperature should not be high to avoid cloggings, so 0 which stands for turning off is highly recommended",更高的腔温可以帮助抑制或减少翘曲，同时可能会提高高温材料（如ABS、ASA、PC、PA等）的层间粘合强度。与此同时，ABS和ASA的空气过滤性能会变差。而对于PLA、PETG、TPU、PVA等低温材料，为了避免堵塞，实际的腔温不应该过高，因此强烈建议使用0（表示关闭）。,✓ Translated,

Since the melt filament may leak from the nozzle during the process of taking a snapshot, prime tower is required for smooth mode to wipe nozzle.",如果启用平滑模式或者传统模式，将在每次打印时生成延时摄影视频。打印完每层后，将用内置相机拍摄快照。打印完成后，所有这些快照会组合成一个延时视频。如果启用平滑模式，打印完每层后，工具头将移动到吐料槽，然后拍摄快照。由于平滑模式在拍摄快照的过程中熔丝可能会从喷嘴中泄漏，因此需要使用擦拭塔进行喷嘴擦拭。,✓ Translated,

"Please find the details of Flow Dynamics Calibration from our wiki.

Usually the calibration is unnecessary. When you start a single color/material print, with the ""flow dynamics calibration"" option checked in the print start menu, the printer will follow the old way, calibrate the filament before the print; When you start a multi color/material print, the printer will use the default compensation parameter for the filament during every filament switch which will have a good result in most cases.

Please note that there are a few cases that can make the calibration results unreliable, such as insufficient adhesion on the build plate. Improving adhesion can be achieved by washing the build plate or applying glue. For more information on this topic, please refer to our Wiki.

The calibration results have about 10 percent jitter in our test, which may cause the result not exactly the same in each calibration. We are still investigating the root cause to do improvements with new updates.","请从我们的wiki中找到动态流量校准的详细信息。

通常情况下，校准是不必要的。当您开始单色/单材料打印，并在打印开始菜单中勾选了“动态流量校准”选项时，打印机将按照旧的方式，在打印前校准丝料；当您开始多色/多材料打印时，打印机将在每次换丝料时使用默认的补偿参数，这在大多数情况下会产生良好的效果。

有几种情况可能导致校准结果不可靠，例如打印板的的附着力不足。清洗打印板或者使用胶水可以增强打印板附着力。您可以在我们的维基上找到更多相关信息。

在我们的测试中，校准结果有约10%的波动，这可能导致每次校准的结果略有不同。我们仍在调查根本原因，并通过新的更新进行改进。",✓ Translated,
